Given that infection is a necessary precondition for a post-infection outcome, one can use principal stratification to partition the total causal effect of vaccination into two causal effects: vaccine efficacy against infection, and the principal effect of vaccine efficacy against a post-infection outcome in the patients that would be infected under both placebo and vaccination. Despite the importance of such principal effects to policymakers, these estimands are generally unidentifiable, even under strong assumptions that are rarely satisfied in real-world trials. We develop a novel method to nonparametrically point identify these principal effects while eliminating the monotonicity assumption and allowing for measurement error. Furthermore, our results allow for multiple treatments, and are general enough to be applicable outside of vaccine efficacy. Our method relies on the fact that many vaccine trials are run at geographically disparate health centers, and measure biologically-relevant categorical pretreatment covariates. We show that our method can be applied to a variety of clinical trial settings where vaccine efficacy against infection and a post-infection outcome can be jointly inferred. This can yield new insights from existing vaccine efficacy trial data and will aid researchers in designing new multi-arm clinical trials.","tags":["Statistics - Methodology","Statistics - Theory","Statistics - Applications"],"title":"Identified vaccine efficacy for binary post-infection outcomes under misclassification without monotonicity","type":"preprints"},{"authors":["Rob Trangucci","Yang Chen","Jon Zelner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1655337600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655411931,"objectID":"e36e28c5f5ce18566ba4b941bded79d8","permalink":"https://rtrangucci.github.io/publication/trangucci-missing-categorical-data/","publishdate":"2022-06-16T20:38:51.650202Z","relpermalink":"/publication/trangucci-missing-categorical-data/","section":"publication","summary":"Characterizing the cumulative burden of COVID-19 by race/ethnicity is of the utmost importance for public health researchers and policy makers in order to design effective mitigation measures. This analysis is hampered, however, by surveillance case data with substantial missingness in race and ethnicity covariates. Worse yet, this missingness likely depends on the values of these missing covariates, i.e. they are not missing at random (NMAR). We propose a Bayesian parametric model that leverages joint information on spatial variation in the disease and covariate missingness processes and can accommodate both MAR and NMAR missingness. We show that the model is locally identifiable when the spatial distribution of the population covariates is known and observed cases can be associated with a spatial unit of observation. We also use a simulation study to investigate the model's finite-sample performance. We compare our model's performance on NMAR data against complete-case analysis and multiple imputation (MI), both of which are commonly used by public health researchers when confronted with missing categorical covariates. Finally, we model spatial variation in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in Wayne County, Michigan using data from the Michigan Department and Health and Human Services. The analysis suggests that population relative risk estimates by race during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan were understated for non-white residents compared to white residents when cases missing race were dropped or had these values imputed using MI.","tags":["Statistics - Methodology","Statistics - Applications"],"title":"Modeling racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19 incidence with covariates subject to non-random missingness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jon Zelner","Rob Trangucci","Ramya Naraharisetti","Alex Cao","Ryan Malosh","Kelly Broen","Nina Masters","Paul Delamater"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655411932,"objectID":"9464d57e8e60f010d24dc7c99d536d5e","permalink":"https://rtrangucci.github.io/publication/zelner-racial-disparities-coronavirus-2021/","publishdate":"2022-06-16T20:38:52.037377Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zelner-racial-disparities-coronavirus-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Racial Disparities in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Mortality Are Driven by Unequal Infection Risks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David E.
